# Belief Model

The Belief Model represents how FAITH agents form and update their internal models of the world.

## Overview

The belief system is the core of the agent's "mind" - it maintains a probabilistic model of the world state, including:

- What objects and agents exist in the environment
- Their properties and relationships
- Causal relationships between actions and outcomes
- Predictions about how the world will change

## Components

### Belief Router

The Belief Router determines which level of processing is needed for incoming perceptual information:

- Simple updates may be handled by local, lightweight models
- Complex reasoning may be routed to more powerful cloud-based LLMs

### Belief LLM Processing

Two tiers of language models support belief updating:

- **Local LLM**: Handles routine belief updates with minimal latency
- **Cloud LLM**: Provides deeper reasoning for complex situations

### Agent Belief System

The central belief repository that maintains:

- Current world model
- Uncertainty estimates
- Memory of past states and events
- Predictions about future states

## Free Energy Principle in Action

The Belief Model implements the core of the Free Energy Principle by:

1. Maintaining prior beliefs about the world
2. Updating these beliefs based on new evidence (perception)
3. Minimizing the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs
4. Adjusting confidence levels based on prediction accuracy

## Implementation Considerations

- Efficient belief representation for real-time processing
- Graceful degradation when cloud services are unavailable
- Balancing belief update frequency with computational resources
