# FAITH: Free-Energy AI for Thinking Humans

## A New Approach to Game AI

FAITH (Faith is Active Inference For Thinking Humans) is a proposed C++ library implementing Active Inference principles to enhance NPC behavior in games.

**⚠️ PRE-PLANNING PHASE ⚠️**

FAITH is currently in the pre-planning and research phase. No code has been implemented yet.

## Core Concepts

    Perception["Perception Model"] --> Belief["Belief Model"]
    Belief --> Action["Action Model"]
    Action --> Execution["Execution Layer"]
    Execution --> Agent["Game Agent"]
    Agent --> Perception
</div>

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Predictive Perception**: NPCs build internal models of the game world
- **Active Inference**: Decision-making based on minimizing surprise
- **Strategic LLM Integration**: Occasional deep reasoning at key moments
