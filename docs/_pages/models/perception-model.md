# Perception Model

The Perception Model is responsible for how FAITH agents sense and process the game world around them.

## Overview

The perception system serves as the agent's interface with the game world, converting raw sensory data into structured information that can be reasoned about. It's the first step in the active inference loop.

## Components

### Vision System

The vision system processes what the agent can "see" in the game world:

- Object detection and classification
- Distance estimation
- Line-of-sight calculations
- Visual memory (what was seen recently)

### Proprioception System

This system tracks the agent's own state:

- Position and orientation
- Current animation state
- Physical capabilities and limitations
- Internal status (health, energy, etc.)

### Sensor Processing

Raw sensory data is processed by specialized components:

- **Vision Camera Agent**: Processes the agent's field of view
- **Object Serializer Agent**: Converts game objects into semantic representations

### Orchestration Layer

The Reasoning Orchestrator combines all sensory information into a coherent representation of the current state, which is then passed to the Belief Model.

## Implementation Considerations

- Balance between realistic limitations and gameplay needs
- Configurable perception capabilities for different agent types
- Efficient processing for real-time game environments
