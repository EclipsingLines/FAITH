# Game-Specific Systems

The Game-Specific Systems layer adapts the FAITH architecture to the unique requirements and mechanics of individual games.

## Overview

While the Core Library provides the fundamental AI capabilities and the Engine Bindings handle engine integration, the Game-Specific Systems layer is where FAITH is tailored to specific game contexts, mechanics, and design goals.

## Customization Areas

### Domain Knowledge

Game-specific knowledge that agents need to understand:

- **Object Ontology**: Defining the types of entities in the game world
- **Action Repertoire**: Specifying available actions and their effects
- **Environmental Rules**: Encoding how the game world operates
- **Goal Structures**: Defining what constitutes success for agents

### Perception Customization

Adapting perception to game-specific sensory information:

- **Custom Sensors**: Specialized perception systems for unique game mechanics
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Prioritizing relevant information in the game context
- **Memory Structures**: Optimized for storing game-specific knowledge

### Behavior Specialization

Tailoring agent behavior to game requirements:

- **Role-Based Policies**: Specialized decision-making for different agent roles
- **Game-Specific Heuristics**: Optimizations for particular gameplay patterns
- **Character Personalities**: Behavioral variations to create diverse NPCs

### Integration Points

Connecting with game systems:

- **Game State Management**: Interfacing with the game's state representation
- **Event Systems**: Hooking into game events and notifications
- **Resource Management**: Adapting to game-specific performance constraints

## Implementation Approach

### Configuration-Driven Design

Much of the game-specific adaptation can be achieved through configuration:

- JSON/YAML configuration files
- Designer-friendly tools
- Runtime-adjustable parameters

### Extension Points

For deeper customization, the architecture provides extension points:

- Custom perception processors
- Specialized belief structures
- Game-specific action evaluators
- Behavior modifiers

### Workflow Integration

Tools to integrate with game development workflows:

- Designer-friendly interfaces
- Debugging visualizations
- Performance monitoring

## Example Adaptations

### RPG Implementation

- Character stats as belief variables
- Quest knowledge representation
- Dialogue system integration
- Combat tactics modeling

### Strategy Game Implementation

- Resource management reasoning
- Strategic goal planning
- Opponent modeling
- Territory control evaluation

### Simulation Game Implementation

- Need-based motivation systems
- Social relationship modeling
- Long-term planning
- Learning from player demonstrations

## Getting Started

To adapt FAITH to your specific game:

1. Identify the core mechanics and entities
2. Map game concepts to FAITH's belief structures
3. Define perception requirements
4. Customize action repertoire
5. Tune decision-making parameters

## Connection to Architecture

The Game-Specific Systems layer connects to:

- [Core Library](core-library.html): The engine-agnostic AI systems
- [Engine Bindings](engine-bindings.html): The engine integration layer
